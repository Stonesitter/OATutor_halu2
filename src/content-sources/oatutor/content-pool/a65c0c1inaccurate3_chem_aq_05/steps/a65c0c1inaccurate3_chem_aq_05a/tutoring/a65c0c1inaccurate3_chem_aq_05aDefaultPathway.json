Calcium has an atomic number of $$20$$, so it has $$20$$ electrons when it's neutral.\\n\\nSince the question is about a Ca\u00e5?\u2030\u0081\u00bc ion, it has lost $$2$$ electrons:\\n\\nNumber of electrons in Ca\u00e5?\u2030\u0081\u00bc $$=$$ $$20$$ - $$2$$ $$=$$ $$18$$\\n\\n**Answer: $$18$$ electrons**",
