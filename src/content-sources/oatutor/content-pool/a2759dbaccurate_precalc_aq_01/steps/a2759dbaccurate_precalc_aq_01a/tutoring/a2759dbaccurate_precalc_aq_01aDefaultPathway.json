        "text": "To solve the expression \\(\\frac{|3x + 9|}{x + 3}\\), we first need to analyze the behavior of the absolute value \\(|3x + 9|\\).\n\n1. \\(\\textbf{When}\\) \\(x + 3 > 0\\)\\(\\textbf{: This implies}\\) \\(x > -3\\).\n   - In this case, the expression inside the absolute value \\(|3x + 9|\\) becomes simply \\(3x + 9\\), as it is positive or zero, so no change occurs.\n   - \\(\\frac{|3x + 9|}{x + 3} = \\frac{3x + 9}{x + 3}\\).\n   - Notice \\(3x + 9\\) can be rewritten as \\(3(x + 3)\\).\n   - So, \\(\\frac{3(x + 3)}{x + 3} = 3\\), assuming \\(x + 3 \\neq 0\\) (and since \\(x > -3\\), it indeed won't be zero).\n\n2. \\(\\textbf{When}\\) \\(x + 3 < 0\\)\\(\\textbf{: This implies}\\) \\(x < -3\\).\n   - Here, the expression \\(|3x + 9| = -(3x + 9)\\) because it becomes negative.\n   - Thus, \\(\\frac{|3x + 9|}{x + 3} = \\frac{-(3x + 9)}{x + 3} = \\frac{-3(x + 3)}{x + 3} = -3\\).\n\nGiven this analysis, the behavior differs on either side of \\(x = -3\\), with:\n\n- \\(3\\) for \\(x > -3\\)\n- \\(-3\\) for \\(x < -3\\)\n\nNote that at \\(x = -3\\) the expression is not defined since it results in a division by zero.\n\nFrom the options provided, the correct solution resembles: \\(\\textbf{\"3 if x > -3 and -3 if x < -3.\"}\\)",
